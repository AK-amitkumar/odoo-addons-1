You need to change the email templates with the following SQL Statements, otherwise the for loop in the table won't work.

Change the english template

update email_template
set body_html = $$ //template// $$
where id = //template_id//

Change the german template

update ir_translation 
set value = $$ //template// $$
where name = 'email.template,body_html' and lang = 'de_DE' and res_id = //template_id//
